"""
Is the venture giving you creative freedom, agency? From None to Total (0-1), how much agency are they giving you?
Could you get the same freedom elsewhere? How confident are you?
How long before you could be in a similar position again?
How much venture cash, equity, IP, would you be willing to bet on that success?
How much lift

Sports Expected Value
(Amount won per bet * probability of winning) â€“ (Amount lost per bet * probability of losing)

I'm treating this primarily as a cost, but that is all negative thinking.
I want to capture the value of creativity on the current project.
Issue is, this creates permutations?...
